# TODO

## Generic capability
- Use nginx:alpine base image to get logging
- Add appropriate traceroute package to container
- For better encapsulation, have the backend PHP script format into XML/HTML
- Have backend PHP script assume CSV from program and format as table
- Have frontend JS look for special XML tag to indicate script is done

## Live trace implementation
- Implement live traceroute
- Implement ping timer and ip host info
- Service menu at root

## Longer term
- How do we know which executable for fpm-php to run?
